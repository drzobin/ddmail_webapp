<p>E-mail system/service for reasonable paranoid people who value security, privacy and anonymity.</p>
DDMail is a email provider with strong focus on security, privacy and anonymity. Unlike many of our competitors we offer OpenPGP encryption "at rest" for emails without storing the users private keys on our servers. The project code, all its server configuration and deployment scripts is open source and can be reviewed and used by anyone. You can use our service or you can start your own selfhosted ddmail alternative by using our code. The pricing model do not depend on how many email accounts you have instead you pay for the total amount of storage independand on how many email accounts, domains, aliases and users you have.
