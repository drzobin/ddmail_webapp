<h3>What is ddmail.se</h3>
E-mail system/service for reasonable paranoid people who value privacy and security.

<h3>Privacy</h3>
We try to honner your privacy. We do not track or monitor your activety. We do not serve ads. We do not use javascript. The service is avalible as a tor onion service(before known as tor hidden service). The service is avalible as a i2p service. No personal information is needed for registration. We provide privacy friendly payment options.

<h3>Security</h3>
We try to use the following design patterns/principle:<br>- less code, less attacksurface<br>- leased privileged<br>- default deny<br>- assume breach<br> The server configuration and application code is all open source and can be reviewed and used by anyone at https://github.com/drzobin. We see all input as evil. We use hard to crack password hashing with argon2. We autoupdate the server software every day. We use mod_security as web application firewall (WAF). We use namespaces and seccomp to sandbox processes. We do not provide any webmail interface.

<h3>Security regarding SMTP and DNS</h3>
We are using DNSSEC, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, CAA, MTA-STS and DANE/TLSA(311) to make the service more resilient to threats.

<h3>DANE/TLSA</h3>
We have DANE/TLSA 311 DNS records for the following services and ports:<br>
SMTP mail.ddmail.se port 25 with STARTTLS<br>
SMTP mail.ddmail.se port 587 with STARTTLS<br>
SMTP mail.ddmail.se over TLS port 465<br>
IMAPS mail.ddmail.se over TLS port 993<br>
HTTPS ddmail.se port 443<br>
HTTPS www.ddmail.se port 443<br>

<h3>Encryption "at rest"</h3>
E-mail is encrypted "at rest" using elliptic curve secp521r1 key pair. The private key is password protected. The password is the email account password base64 encoded. This encryption/decryption is done seamlessly to the user on the server. Every e-mail account(Maildir) has different key pairs. 

<h3>Encryption "in transit"</h3>
E-mail is encrypted "in transit" as offen as possible using TLS encryption. IMAP and HTTP is always encryptet using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites, A+ rating on ssllab. SMTP traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites when the counter part SMTP server supports it.
