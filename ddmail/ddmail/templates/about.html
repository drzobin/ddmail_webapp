<h2>About</h2>
<p>Here you can find information regarding ddmail e-mail system/service.</p>

<h3>What is ddmail.se</h3>
E-mail system/service for reasonable paranoid people who value privacy and security.

<h3>Privacy and anonymity</h3>
We try to honner our users privacy and anonymity. We do not track or monitor users activety. We do not serve ads. We do not use javascript. We do not save/log the users ip when using HTTPS or IMAPS. The service is avalible as a tor onion service(before known as tor hidden service). The service is avalible as a i2p service. No personal information is needed for registration. We provide privacy friendly payment options.

<h3>Security</h3>
We try to use the following design patterns/principle:<br>- less code, less attacksurface<br>- leased privileged<br>- default deny<br>- assume breach<br> The server configuration and application code is all open source and can be reviewed and used by anyone at https://github.com/drzobin. We see all input as evil. We use hard to crack password hashing with argon2. We autoupdate the server software every day. We use mod_security as web application firewall (WAF). We use apparmore as mandatory access control (MAC) in enforce mode. We use apparmore, namespaces and seccomp to sandbox processes. We do not provide any webmail interface.

<h3>Security regarding SMTP and DNS</h3>
We are using DNSSEC, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, CAA, MTA-STS and DANE/TLSA(311) to make the service more resilient to threats.

<h3>DANE/TLSA</h3>
We have DANE/TLSA 311 DNS records for the following services and ports:<br>
SMTP mail.ddmail.se port 25 (with support for STARTTLS)<br>
SMTP mail.ddmail.se port 587 (with support for STARTTLS)<br>
SMTPS mail.ddmail.se port 465 (SMTP wrapped in TLS)<br>
IMAPS mail.ddmail.se port 993 (IMAP wrapped in TLS)<br>
HTTPS ddmail.se port 443 (HTTP wrapped in TLS)<br>
HTTPS www.ddmail.se port 443 (HTTP wrapped in TLS)<br>

<h3>Security regarding mail content</h3>
We use clamav, oletools with olefy and rspamd to fight malware, phishing and spam.

<h3>Encryption "at rest"</h3>
E-mail is always encrypted "at rest" using elliptic curve secp521r1 private and public key pair. The private key is password protected. The password is the email account password base64 encoded. This encryption/decryption is done seamlessly to the user on the server. Every e-mail account(Maildir) has different key pairs. The password protected private key is stored on ddmail servers.

<h3>Encryption "at rest" using OpenPGP</h3>
Incoming emails can also be encrypted using OpenPGP public keys. This means that incoming emails will be encrypted twice "at rest". This is a opt-in feature where the user needs to upload the OpenPGP public key to ddmail servers and activate OpenPGP encryption on specific email account with a specific public key. Using this feature the users OpenPGP private key is not stored on ddmail servers.

<h3>Encryption "in transit"</h3>
E-mail is encrypted "in transit" as offen as possible using TLS encryption. IMAP and HTTP is always encryptet using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites, A+ rating on ssllab. SMTP traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites when the counter part SMTP server supports it.

<h3>Features</h3>
Unlimited number of e-mails accounts per account. Unlimited number of aliases per account. Unlimited number of own domains per account. Avalible as Tor Onion Service. Avalible as i2p service. Protocol supported for getting emails is imaps and protocol supported for sendning email is smtp.

<h3>License</h3>
All code and server configuration is open source and licensed under GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

<h3>Where can i find the code</h3>
All development is done in the open using github. The code is located at https://github.com/drzobin.

<h3>For how long is backup saved</h3>
Backups are saved for 7 days. This means that if you remove you account, account user, email account or alias it takes 7 days before all the data is gone. This also means that when you change any password you need to save the old password for 7 days.

<h3>Where is it hosted</h3>
The system/service and all its data is hosted in Sweden.

<h3>Who is behind this</h3>
Run and created by Robin "drz/drzobin" Larsson from Sweden.

<p>Happy mailing :)</p>
