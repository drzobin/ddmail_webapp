<h2>About</h2>
<p>Here you can find information regarding ddmail e-mail system/service.</p>

<h3>What is ddmail.se</h3>
E-mail system/service for reasonable paranoid people who value privacy and security.

<h3>Privacy</h3>
We try to honner your privacy. We do not track you. We do not log or save your ip. We do not serve ads. We do not use javascript. The service is avalible as a tor onion service(before known as tor hidden service). The service is avalible as a i2p service. No personal information is needed for registration. We provide privacy friendly payment options.

<h3>Security</h3>
We try to use the following design patterns/principle:<br>- less code, less attacksurface<br>- leased privileged<br>- default deny<br>- assume breach<br> The server configuration and application code is all open source and can be reviewed and used by anyone at https://github.com/drzobin. We see all input as evil. We use hard to crack password hashing with argon2. We autoupdate the server software every day. We use mod_security as web application firewall (WAF). We use namespaces and seccomp to sandbox processes. We do not provide any webmail interface.

<h3>Security regarding SMTP and DNS</h3>
We are using DNSSEC, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, CAA and MTA-STS to make the service more resilient to State-Sponsored threats.

<h3>Encryption "at rest"</h3>
E-mail is encrypted "at rest" using elliptic curve secp521r1 password protected private keys. The private key password is the email account password base64 encoded. This encryption/decryption is done seamlessly to the user on the server. Every e-mail account(Maildir) has different private/public keys. 

<h3>Encryption "in transit"</h3>
E-mail is encrypted "in transit" as offen as possible using TLS encryption. IMAP and HTTP is always encryptet using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites, A+ rating on ssllab. SMTP traffic is encrypted using TLS when the counter part SMTP server supports it.

<h3>Features</h3>

<h3>License</h3>
